          <h2>Latest Bitcoin Codebase</h2>
          <p>
            Particl is built on the Bitcoin codebase and is <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/blockchain/bitcoin-codebase" target="_blank">always maintained to its latest version</a>. This allows the Particl network to leverage the Bitcoin ecosystem and unlock all of its security, stability, and usability benefits. It also enables any developer to port existing Bitcoin products and merge them into the Particl ecosystem, expanding its reach and functionalities.

          <h2>Cold Staking</h2>
          <p>
            Staking your funds on Particl rewards you with all the transaction and market fees of the network in exchange for securing the network. <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/staking" target="_blank">Cold Staking</a> means you can do it even when your funds are stored offline or in hardware devices (i.e. Ledger Nano or Trezor). Cold staking lets you securely delegate your staking power to cold staking nodes which contain no coin but provide a dedicated connection to the Particl network. Cold staking nodes can stake funds on your behalf, but can’t spend them. You can stake your funds on your own cold staking nodes or using a <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/staking/pools" target="blank">staking pool</a>.

          <h2>Private Marketplace</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="/marketplace/">Particl's decentralized marketplace</a> is built with privacy at its core and offers a low-cost, secure and scalable e-commerce experience. Designed to work with almost any coin, it uses several privacy-enhancing features such as default private transactions, encrypted data, secure messaging, IP address anonymization, metadata stripping, private listings and more. It is exclusively governed by the Particl community which also earns all the fees generated by the marketplace.

          <h2>Decentralized Applications</h2>
          <p>
            Particl is designed so that users can easily use and build decentralized applications that can then be integrated directly into <a href="https://particl.wiki/tutorial/particl-desktop/start" target="_blank">Particl Desktop</a>. These applications foster the decentralized, private and trustless Particl economy and are built using native privacy smart-contracts.

          <h2>CT &amp; RingCT</h2>
          <p>
            The Particl coin, PART, is a private currency that can be transacted with <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/transaction-types" target="_blank">three different levels of privacy</a>: public, blind, and anonymous. Each of these privacy levels possess their own degree of traceability and cost. The Confidential Transactions protocol, used for blind transactions, keeps the transacting amounts private on the blockchain while RingCT makes transactions completely anonymous by keeping the participants’ identities private as well.

          <h2>Atomic Swaps<br><small class="tag">(IN DEVELOPMENT)</small></h2>
          <p>
            Particl uses <a href="https://github.com/particl/atomicswap" target="_blank">atomic swaps</a> and third-party integrations to accept a wide range of cryptocurrencies while still keeping your privacy intact, regardless of the currency being used. Atomic swaps enable cryptocurrencies to be safely exchanged without the need for a third-party. While the Particl platform requires PART to function because of its privacy and smart-contract capabilities, any non-PART transaction is automatically converted into PART so that you can effortlessly use your favorite coin when using Particl.

          <h2>Smart contracts</h2>
          <p>
            Decentralized applications on Particl are all about your privacy and security first. They operate autonomously using secure smart-contracts and do not generate any traceable data that can then be collected by third-parties. This is made possible thanks to a combination of several privacy protocols including SMSG, RingCT, Confidential Transactions, stealth addresses, Tor, and others.

          <h2>Lightweight and Scalable</h2>
          <p>
            Particl is a lightweight distributed network built to stay fast and efficient even when under heavy loads of traffic. It uses several protocols to <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/blockchain/blockchain-scalability" target="_blank">improve the scalability</a> of its blockchain such as Segregated Witness and Bulletproofs. It also uses <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/market/smsg" target="_blank">SMSG</a>, a P2P network running alongside the Particl blockchain, to securely store data and messages. This causes the size of the Particl blockchain to remain as small as possible.

          <h2>Double Deposit MAD Escrow</h2>
          <p>
            Particl’s marketplace allows you to safely transact with anyone in the world without requiring the assistance of a third-party and without blindly trusting the other party you’re transacting with. Particl’s <a href="https://particl.wiki/learn/market/mad-escrow" target="_blank">double deposit escrow system</a> requires two parties to make an equal security deposit that only gets refunded when both parties agree to release the funds. As this escrow system doesn’t require any intermediary, it is free of charge and entirely private.
